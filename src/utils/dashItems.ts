You'll encounter the island's famous giant tortoises, descendants of four Aldabra tortoises gifted by Seychelles in 1919. These majestic creatures have thrived here, and the island now boasts a nursery where you can see baby tortoises of various ages. After exploring the island's history, you can enjoy snorkeling among vibrant coral reefs or relax with some sunbathing and swimming in the pristine waters nearby.",
